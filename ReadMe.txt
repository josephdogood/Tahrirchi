Question 1
There are multiple ways to automate of getting new datasets everyday.
1 - Telegram bot
We can create telegram bot that will get datasets by clicking a button in tg bot, and set 'csv' file to user.
2 - Script
We can write script and give time to this script, that will work at given time only or by the command of user. For example, given time is 7:30am, script will automatically get datasets and send to user.

Question 2
The most appropriate and used file format to store datasets is 'csv' file format, but for massive data better way is to use databases such as, PostgreSQL, MySQL or even better MongoDB.

Question 3
I followed the given instructions, so on my mind, quality is poor, due to it does not have the time when news is uploaded, images or videos related to news.
